### Projects:
[Transporter App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kobo-transporter/id1476194142?ls=1)<br/>
Led a team of 5 engineers in building a completely new pan-african logistics solution with a robust architecture which in turn increased the app's adoption rate by 800% using flutter framework. This was achieved by using flutter's clean code architecture incorporating the bloc design pattern. The solution also offered a native map implementation that gives 100% asset visibility hereby improving the app's reliability.
